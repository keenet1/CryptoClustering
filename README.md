## Background
The primary goal of this project was to use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. K-means clustering was employed as the primary analytical technique and the data was explored both in its original state as well as after reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Visualizations
First, a plot was generated to show the returns for several crypto currencies and for several different holding periods:

Elbow curves were also generated to compare the original data to the date after Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

The final analysis made use of cluster graphs to compare he original data to the date after Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
